Overflows and Underflows are problem in smart contract before v8.0 and we have to use the additions and substractions carefully otherwise it may lead to serious damage. In this case we are given 20 tokens and if we try to send the 21 tokens in the _value of the transfer function, require will pass as it will underflow and will have the largest uint256 integer and it will lead us to have largest amount of tokens with us.
